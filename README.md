# FinalSeating-App3

Using this app any student at Cate school can search up their names in the search bar and find their formal dinner table. Not only will they get their placement but they will be able to see every one at their table and the waiter as well.


After searching your name, click search and click the "view tables" button on the upper right side to see your table.

It is a quick and easy way of finding your information!  

Never again will you forget your table and have to fight through a crowd to see the printed list.

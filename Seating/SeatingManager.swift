//Goal: send someone's name to localhost:80 and return their table (a dictionary)

/*
 TODO:
 - Make Swift able to unmarshal JSON by telling it the key names
 - Error handling:
    - Python needs to see if there's gonna be an error and return an error message
    - Swift needs to check if it received an error and print it accordingly.
